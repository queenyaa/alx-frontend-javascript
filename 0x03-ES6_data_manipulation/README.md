Task 0, which involves creating a function named `getListStudents` that returns an array of student objects, holds several key importance in the context of software development:

1. **Understanding of Data Structure Handling**: This task provides an opportunity for developers to demonstrate their proficiency in handling data structures in JavaScript. By creating an array of objects with specific attributes, developers showcase their ability to work with complex data structures.

2. **Function Creation and Modularity**: The task necessitates the creation of a function that encapsulates a specific functionality. This promotes the principle of modularity in software development, where code is organized into reusable and self-contained functions, enhancing code maintainability and readability.

3. **Compliance with Specifications**: Task 0 outlines specific requirements for the format and content of the returned array of student objects. Adhering to these specifications demonstrates the developer's attention to detail and ability to implement functionality according to given requirements, an essential skill in real-world projects.

4. **Testing and Verification**: After implementing the `getListStudents` function, the provided test script ensures that the function behaves as expected. This emphasizes the importance of testing in software development to verify that the implemented functionality meets the desired criteria and to catch any potential errors or bugs.

5. **Documentation and Readability**: As part of the requirements, a README.md file is mandated, which serves as documentation for the project. Documenting the purpose and usage of the `getListStudents` function enhances project maintainability and assists other developers in understanding and utilizing the codebase effectively.

6. **Integration with Tooling**: The task specifies the use of tools such as Jest for testing and ESLint for linting. Integrating these tools into the development workflow ensures code quality, adherence to coding standards, and the identification of potential issues early in the development process.

Overall, Task 0 plays a crucial role in reinforcing fundamental concepts of JavaScript programming, promoting best practices in software development, and preparing developers for real-world scenarios where adherence to specifications, modularity, and code quality are paramount.

### Task 1 : 1-get_list_student_ids.js
---

Task 1 holds significance in the following aspects of software development:

1. **Data Manipulation Proficiency**: By creating the `getListStudentIds` function, developers demonstrate their ability to manipulate complex data structures. This task requires extracting specific data (i.e., the `id` attribute) from an array of objects, showcasing proficiency in data manipulation techniques.

2. **Error Handling**: The task specifies that if the input argument is not an array, the function should return an empty array. Implementing this behavior demonstrates the developer's understanding of error handling and defensive programming practices, ensuring the function gracefully handles unexpected inputs.

3. **Functional Programming Principles**: Utilizing the `map` function to transform each object in the array into its `id` attribute exemplifies the application of functional programming principles. Functional programming promotes the use of higher-order functions and immutable data structures, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and testability.

4. **Reusability and Modularity**: The `getListStudentIds` function encapsulates a specific functionality, making it reusable and modular. Modular code facilitates code reuse across different parts of an application, promoting code efficiency and reducing redundancy.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Testing the `getListStudentIds` function ensures that it behaves as expected under various scenarios. Thorough testing validates the correctness of the implementation, verifies adherence to specifications, and identifies potential edge cases or bugs early in the development cycle.

6. **Code Quality and Standards Compliance**: Implementing the function in accordance with the task requirements demonstrates adherence to coding standards and best practices. Writing clean, well-structured code enhances code quality, fosters collaboration among team members, and facilitates code maintenance and scalability.

7. **Documentation and Communication**: Documenting the purpose, usage, and behavior of the `getListStudentIds` function in the README.md file promotes effective communication within development teams. Clear documentation aids in understanding the function's functionality, enabling seamless integration into larger projects.

In summary, Task 1 plays a vital role in reinforcing fundamental programming concepts, promoting code quality and maintainability, and preparing developers for real-world scenarios where data manipulation, error handling, and functional programming principles are essential.
