10. **Task 9**: Advanced Error Handling with `try-catch-finally`:
    - Task 9 expands on error handling with `try-catch` by including a `finally` block.
    - It involves creating a function that catches errors, executes cleanup actions, and returns the appropriate result.

11. **Task 10**: Async/Await and Dependency Management:
    - Task 10 integrates async/await syntax and dependency management with Promises.
    - It involves creating an async function that calls multiple async functions, handles errors, and combines their results.

Overall, the navigation from Task 0 to 10 progresses from basic Promise handling to more advanced concepts such as async/await syntax, error handling, dependency management, and Promise composition. Each task builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity and covering a broader range of asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript.
