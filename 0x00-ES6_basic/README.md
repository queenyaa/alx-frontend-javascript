# Readme of 0x00-ES6_basic

JavaScript ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to the JavaScript language standard. It introduced many new features and syntax enhancements to make JavaScript programming more efficient, expressive, and powerful. Some of the key features introduced in ES6 include:
let and const
arrow functions
template literals
default parameters
rest and spread operators
destructuring assignment
classes
modules
promises
new data structures like 'Map' and 'Set'

Object Creation and Properties:

    methods for creating objects and defining their properties in JavaScript, including:
        Object literal syntax.
        Constructor functions.
        Class syntax.
        Object.create() method.

Iterators and for...of Loops:

    iterators and the for...of loop, which are features introduced in ES6 for iterating over iterable objects.
    Iterators are objects with a next() method that returns values from a sequence.
    The for...of loop simplifies iteration over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and user-defined iterables.
